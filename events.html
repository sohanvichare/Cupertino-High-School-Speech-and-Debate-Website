Using parliamentary law, students debate and vote upon bills and resolutions regarding national and international problems. From this event, students learn research and analysis skills as well as extemporaneous and impromptu speaking skills. Further, students become familiar with current social and political problems and learn the appropriate behavior and rules for formal meetings. Students are evaluated on their analysis of the arguments, use of evidence, skill in asking and answering questions, and techniques of good speaking.</p>

            <div class="wow fadeInUp">
              <p class="flow-text">Lincoln-Douglas debate, known as individual or value debate, is often used in political campaigns. There is an affirmative speaker and a negative speaker. All contestants debate the same general topic, but approaches to the topic will vary. Rather than debating the merits of a particular plan or policy, students focus on a reasoned clash over the merit for the value implied in the resolution. Both speakers carry the burden of refutation and rebuttal. The focus of LD debate is not a clash of evidence but a clash of values (with evidence to support arguments.) Judging should be based on effective presentation and defense of one student’s side of the value, taking into account direct clash of issues, organization, logic, analysis, evidence, sportsmanship, and persuasiveness. </p>
